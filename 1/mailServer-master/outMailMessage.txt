HAPPY HALLOWEEN!
If it isn’t the witches, werewolves, or goblins that haunt us every Halloween,
it’s the ghastly task of deciding what to wear! Do the spooky creatures of the night face a similar ordeal?
Today’s Doodle checks in on Jinx, the lonely ghost, who embarks on a mission to find the perfect costume —
and a place to belong.

Last year, Momo successfully defended Magic Cat Academy from the clutches of a mischievous ghost invasion.
This year, Jinx desperately wants to join Momo and the other trick-or-treaters outside.
Not wanting to scare anyone, the lonely ghost agonizes over a costume to blend in with the
trick-or-treaters, wreaking havoc in the process. In the end, Jinx finds wearing a disguise is no match
for being yourself.
